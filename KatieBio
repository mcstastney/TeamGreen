<h1>About Katie</h1>
<h2>Career Switching from Marketing to Software Engineering</h2>
<p>I am a Marketing Executive looking to develop my skills in order to become a software engineer.</p>
<p>During my work as a project manager for a charity that helped disabled adults and children, I became interested in software development. When I led a project to make technology accessible for everyone, I became aware of the digital divide that exists. Seeing the challenges the people we supported faced and how tech could change their lives made me want to be part of tackling the divide by creating technology for everyone.</p>

  <li>Completed a project in Python that involved using a weather API to retrieve the latest weather conditions and then curate a music playlist for the user depending on the weather that day.</li>
</ul>

<p>I aspire to further develop my coding skills and engage in more coding projects. By immersing myself in coding tasks, I aim to gain a better understanding of the standards and routines followed by professional software developers. Through hands-on experience and continuous learning, I seek to refine my abilities and contribute effectively to the field of technology.</p>
