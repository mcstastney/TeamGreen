    <h1>About Majella</h1>
    <p>I'm a Teacher, Wellbeing Mentor and Professional Coach transitioning to a career as a Software developer.</p>
    <p>What has inspired me to take up coding...?
        I chose to specialise in ICT during my post graduate teacher training and have led the Computer Science Curriculum at KeyStage 2.  
        I discovered that creating coding projects were the highlight of my week and a brilliant way for my students - and me!- to have a lot of 
        fun whilst also being creative and problem-solving.</p>
